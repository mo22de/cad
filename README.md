Warning I spent only 20 minutes to create these so some in accuracies may exist 

The Iges files for retro populator

Need table saw or laser cutter for all parts
note there are both metric and imperial units.  Imperial tools & hardware, metric spacing.

### Pinplate
This is the fixture base, can be created with either a milling machine or cnc mill. In desperation you could try a drill press.

### Boardwall
Need 2

These rails are glued to the base plate. Can be created with a mill, cnc, or 2mm saw blade OR the 1mm woodruff cutter.

### Railspacers
Need 4

Are screwed to the pinplate. Can be made with mill or drill press.

### 8mm rail
Need 6 to 10

These are screwed to the rail spacers. Mill.  Will need a 1 mm woodruff cutter. I made my own. Could try 3d printing these.

### Aarm
Need 4

Are attached to the base plate, screw or glue hand drill is fine

### wing
Need 2

These are attached to the Aarm and a set of screws should be inserted to align to the printers base plate. this makes for the quick change out.

### Cam locks
Need a wack of em, can be 3d printed but better to cnc with that 1mm woodruff.

1/8x.5 dowel pin is added to them.

Nozzle components comming soon

Review the videos to see where it all fits.  Assembly drawing with labels coming soon.

Good luck
