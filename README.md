# Retro Populator CAD Files: Version 1

### Build Instructions

Warning I spent only 20 minutes to create these so some in accuracies may exist 

The Iges files for retro populator

Need table saw or laser cutter for all parts
note there are both metric and imperial units.  Imperial tools & hardware, metric spacing.

#### Pinplate
This is the fixture base, can be created with either a milling machine or cnc mill. In desperation you could try a drill press.

#### Boardwall
Need 2

These rails are glued to the base plate. Can be created with a mill, cnc, or 2mm saw blade OR the 1mm woodruff cutter.

#### Railspacers
Need 4

Are screwed to the pinplate. Can be made with mill or drill press.

#### 8mm rail
Need 6 to 10

These are screwed to the rail spacers. Mill.  Will need a 1 mm woodruff cutter. I made my own. Could try 3d printing these.

#### Aarm
Need 4

Are attached to the base plate, screw or glue hand drill is fine

#### wing
Need 2

These are attached to the Aarm and a set of screws should be inserted to align to the printers base plate. this makes for the quick change out.

#### Cam locks
Need a wack of em, can be 3d printed but better to cnc with that 1mm woodruff.

1/8x.5 dowel pin is added to them.

Nozzle components comming soon

Review the videos to see where it all fits.  Assembly drawing with labels coming soon.

Good luck

## Usage

**Note:** The useage instructions are a work in progress.

### Initial Setup (1 time)

#### 1. Position the Jig

* needle should be perfectly positioned over one of the holes
* confirming the jig orienation and alignment

#### 2. Calibrate the Z Endstop Extension

* screw the z endstop onto the z

#### 3. Install PopCAM

* See [https://github.com/retropopulator/popcam#installation-osx-and-linux](PopCAM Installation Instructions)


### Regular Setup

#### 1. Align the first circuit board

* 1.1 Insert your first circuit board at the intersection of the two board walls (the furthest corner from the alignement screws). Make sure to fit your board in the slots along each wall.
* 1.2 Insert your first camlock with the larger diameter towards the board in the hole closest to the other edge of your first circuit board.
* 1.3 Rotate the camlock to engage the circuit board, holding it in place against the board walls. Make sure your board is still in the slots on the rail and that it is in the slot on the camlock.
* 1.4 Add a second camlock to the last open side of the board, rotating it into position in the same way you did the first camlock (see 1.2 and 1.3).

**Note:** An additional camlock may be required on one of the board sides when placing multiple boards.

#### 2. Aligning the rest of the circuit boards

* 2.1 Stack additional boards against the camlocks holding previous boards.

#### 3. Insert the tapes

* Put the peg in
* While being careful not to knock components off the tape, peel the plastic cover off.
* Remove peg. Be careful not to shift the tape or knock the components off it.

#### 4. Position the jig

* Slide the jig into the 3D printer until the alignment screws are pressed against the edge of the build platform.

#### 5. Configure PopCAM

* More info comming soon. For now refer to the popcam docs.
